In this project the goal was to implement a basic version of blocks world.
This version of blocks world set the number of avaible spaces for the 
blocks as well as the total number of blocks between three and ten. In my
version, all moveable blocks(blocks on top of their respective index), 
will find all possible locations they could move to. One of those blocks 
moves will be selected as a "random movement" and will be moved 
accordingly. Every run, the game will check whether all blocks have been 
assembled in order on one spot, if they are the game will end.

Due to the way the random moves work, I wasn't able to get a final run. 
The game could run on forever because there is no bias towards making a 
"correct move".
